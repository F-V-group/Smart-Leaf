# about it

<p> 
  The project aims to create a controlled environment similar to a greenhouse, being a smart vegetable garden, to facilitate the cultivation of small vegetables. This is because many people want to grow their plants, but do not have space and time necessary to do, so we think of developing a solution to it. Firstly we verified through field research the necessity of the target audience of our project and confirmed the problems that we propose to solve. So Smart Leaf uses automated processes to meet the needs of the plant and monitor it. With the developed system the individual will have the job of just placing the seed in a removable pot inside the Smart Leaf, after which the electrical system. composed of sensors, lamps, an Arduino, a display and a cooler that will monitor the humidity of the soil and air, as well, control the temperature and brightness of the environment, as well as the integrated hydraulic system, which aims to control soil moisture by watering the plant when needed.
